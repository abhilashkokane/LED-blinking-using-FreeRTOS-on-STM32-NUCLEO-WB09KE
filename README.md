# LED-blinking-using-FreeRTOS-on-STM32-NUCLEO-WB09KE

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **FreeRTOS** on the **STM32 NUCLEO-WB09KE** development board to implement a basic multitasking system where multiple LEDs are blinked at different rates. The project also integrates **Segger SystemView** for runtime analysis, providing insights into CPU usage, task execution times and system tick behavior.

## Blinking LEDs using FreeRTOS
In this project, LED blinking is managed using **FreeRTOS tasks** instead of traditional `HAL_Delay()` loops. FreeRTOS provides:
- **Task Scheduling** â€“ Each LED blink pattern is implemented as a separate task. The scheduler ensures fair CPU time allocation.
- **Deterministic Timing** â€“ Using system ticks, tasks are executed at precise intervals.
- **Concurrency** â€“ Multiple LEDs can blink at different frequencies without blocking each other.
- **Scalability** â€“ More tasks (e.g., UART communication, sensor reading) can be easily added.

## Runtime Analysis with Segger SystemView
To evaluate system performance, **Segger SystemView** is integrated for real-time tracing and analysis:
- **CPU Usage** â€“ Monitors how much processing time is consumed by tasks vs. idle time.
- **Task Execution Time** â€“ Measures the run time of individual tasks for performance tuning.
- **SysTick Monitoring** â€“ Observes FreeRTOS tick interrupts and scheduler behavior.
